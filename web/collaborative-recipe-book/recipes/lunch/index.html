      <center><h2>1)<u> Paneer Tikka Masala</u></h2></center>
      <h4>Paneer Tikka Masala is a flavorful Indian dish that combines marinated paneer cubes coated with Indian spices, with a rich, creamy tomato sauce.<br> This recipe is a favorite in Indian cuisine and is known for its tangy, spicy, and slightly smoky taste.</h4>

      <h3>For Tikka </h3>
      <img src="https://vegbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ingredients-for-paneer-tikka-recipe.jpg" height="235" width="200"<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Paneer (Indian Cottage Cheese)- Paneer is the star ingredient for this recipe. Procure it locally. Make sure that it is fresh. For vegan, swap it with Tofu.</li>
        <li>  Onions- Red onions work best.</li>
          <li>Capsicum- Green capsicum adds color and spicy flavor. I recommend using it, although you may try it with other bell peppers as well.</li>
          <li>Indian Spices- Red chili powder, Kasoori Methi, and salt. You may also add garam masala and coriander powder.</li>
         <li> Fresh lemon juice: Fresh lemon juice adds tangy flavor.</li>
          <li>Besan (Gram Flour)- Besan adds a coating to the paneer cubes and adds much flavor to it.</li>
          <li>Curd- We use regular curd with drained water. You can hang it overnight. If there is water in curd, it will make the marinade runny and we won't be able to make perfect tikka.</li>
          <li>Oil- Sesame oil or mustard oil works best.</li>

          <h3>For Gravy </h3>
      <img src="https://vegbuffet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ingredients-for-paneer-tikka-gravy.jpg" height="235" width="200"<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Onions- Red onions give best flavor to the gravy.</li>
        <li> Garlic- I love the addition of fresh garlic. You may use the garlic powder, though.</li>
          <li>Tomatoes- Fresh red tomatoes add tart and flavor to the gravy.</li>
          <li>Cashews- Cashews add a creamy texture to the gravy. By far, this is the best way to have healthy and creamy gravies.</li>
         <li> Whole Spices- Cardamom, cinnamon stick, bayleaf, cloves, whole black pepper corns, dried red chillies, dried fenugreek leaves (kasoori methi) . I have also used Paneer Tikka Spice Blend /masala from GM brands</li>
          <li>Sesame Oil-You may use any oil/ ghee of your choice.</li>
          
      </ul>
      <h3>How To Make Paneer Tikka Masala</h3>
      <h4>Step 1. Make Tawa Paneer Tikka<br>
        Step 1.1 Marinate Paneer Cubes</h4>
        <P>Wash and chop veggies. Paneer in large cubes. Halve the onion and ut each half into quarters to get large chunks. Gently separate the onion layers to create individual petals. 
          <br>Similarly, cut large chunks of capsicum.In a large bowl, mix yogurt, all powdered spices, kasoori methi, lemon juice, and salt. Add paneer cubes, onion and capsicum chunks to the marinade.
          <br> Mix well and let it sit for at least 30 minutes.</P>

          <h4>Step 1.2 Cook Paneer Tikka on Tawa</h4>

          <h4>Step 2. Prepare Gravy<br>
            Step 2.1 Boil all ingredients</h4>

            <p>The easiest way and fail-proof method of the paneer gravy is to boil all ingredients for the gravy in a pressure cooker. 
              <br>It saves your time and gives the best flavor.

             <br> In a pressure cooker, add washed and roughly chopped tomatoes, onion, garlic, green chilies, whole spices, cashews. Cover with water to just soak them.
              
             <br>Boil for 2 whistles on full and slow cook for 5-8 minutes.
              
              </p>
              <h4>Step 2.2 Cool Off</h4>
              <p>Let the boiled veggies cool off. Strain the water into a bowl and store it for adding later to the gravy.<br>

                Blend the boiled veggies (remove bay leaf, cinnamon stick) into a smooth paste. Make sure the boiled veggies have cooled off. Not every food processor can blend hot stuff.</p>

              <h4>Step 2.3 Temper the gravy</h4>
              <p>In a heavy-bottomed wok or pan, heat oil. Add dried red chilies, whole spices which we didn't blend - bayleaf and cinnamon sticks.<br>
                 Add the smooth puree of onion-tomato. Let it cook on slow flame for 4-5 minutes.<br>
                  Add all spices, salt and cook for another 2-3 minutes. It will absorb the moisture and become a large lump. <br>
                Add the stored water for gravy and again cook till the gravy thickens</p>

<center><h2> 2)<u> Chana Saag</u></h2></center>
<h4>Chana Saag, made with dry chickpeas and fresh leafy greens is a popular Indian recipe.<br>
   Simmered in coconut milk, onion, garlic, tomato gravy, and Indian warm spices, this is a comfort meal with rice or paratha for busy weeknights!</h4>

   <h3>ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Saag- is the main ingredient for this recipe. I have used a combination of fresh spinach leaves, and mustard greens. <br>
      Feel free to use just spinach or baby spinach leaves, kale, or a combination of any other leafy greens.<br>
       I have added more chickpeas than saag and used a chopped version of saag instead of pureed. But this ratio can be customized.<br>
       If you love more saag, feel free to double up the quantity given in the recipe card. </li>
       <li>Garbanzo Beans- I have soaked dry chickpeas and boiled them the night before. <br>
        You may use canned chickpeas as well. Make sure to drain the water from them and rinse them or boil for 5-10 min before using. <br>
        For the dry chickpeas, you may find boiling instructions in my recipe- Punjabi Chana Masala.</li>
        <li>Onions- Red onions work best.You may use white onions as well.</li>
        <li>Tomato- Fresh tomatoes work best. I have used chopped tomatoes. You may use tomato puree or tomato paste too.</li>
        <li>Garlic- Fresh garlic cloves add amazing flavor and depth. I recommend using fresh garlic. though you may use ginger garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Ginger: Freshly Grated Ginger works well. I had added it while boiling chickpeas. If you are using a can of chickpeas, you may add it with garlic.</li>
<li>Green Chilly:  I love leafy greens with green chilies. I have added the chopped fresh green chilly. Feel free to adjust the heat as this is going to be very spicy.</li>
<li>Ghee: Saag in India can't be made without Ghee. I can't enjoy it without Ghee. If you wish to make vegan chana saag, you may use olive oil or any other vegetable cooking oil.</li>
<li>Coconut Milk- Coconut milk balances the spicy flavors and adds a rich creamy base to this recipe. While you may use any cream, I wanted to give it authentic flavor and make it healthy too. You may use cashew cream as well.</li>
<li>Spices and Salt: Red chili powder, turmeric powder, and chana Masala are the spices I have used. You may also add garam masala, coriander powder. Normal salt works well.</li>
<li>Cilantro Leaves (optional): Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>How to Make Chana Saag</h2>
   <h3> Step 1 Prepping the Saag</h3>
   <p>Wash and chop the spinach leaves, mustard greens, onions, tomatoes, garlic, and green chili. I have already boiled the chickpeas in the morning.

    <br>Place the washed and chopped spinach mustard greens in a colander to drain excess water. If you are using frozen leafy greens, make sure to thaw them and blanch them for a few minutes before using them.</p>
