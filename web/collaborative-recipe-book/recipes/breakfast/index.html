      <h5>A classical north indian stuffed bread recipe made with wheat flour and spiced potato mash for stuffing. <br>It is one of the popular paratha recipes which is not only easy to make but also one of the tasty stuffed bread from the indian cuisine</h5>
      
      <h3>Recipe Module : -</h3>
      <h3>What ingredients will I need?</h3>

      <ul>
       <Li> Potatoes (aloo) - make sure you use a starchy variety of potato as this is best for mashing.</Li>
      <li>Ginger, garlic and green chillies – key components of any good recipe!</li>
      <li>Fresh coriander (optional) – for a little colour and flavour.</li>
      <li>Spices – turmeric, chilli powder, ground cumin, and ground coriander.</li>
      <li>Butter or ghee – for delicious rich flavour.</li>
      <li>Chapati atta (flour) – this is a whole wheat flour used for making chapatis and can be purchased from your local South Asian grocery  store.</li>
      <li>Chana (chickpea) flour – adding a small amount of chana flour to the dough keeps our parathas soft and fluffy.</li>
      <li>Warm (not boiling) water – to make the dough.</li>
      <li>Sunflower oil – for frying the parathas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to make easy aloo paratha step by step:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li> Begin by preparing the filling: add the mashed potato and other ingredients to a bowl (photo 1) and mix until combined (photo 2). Set the filling aside for later.</li> 
        <br><li>To make the paratha dough, first mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Then gradually add the warm water (photo 3), stirring with a spoon or with your hands until it just comes together.</li>

        <img src="https://shivanilovesfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aloo-Paratha-2.jpg" height = "200">
        <li>Once you have a scraggly dough (photo 4), tip this onto a floured work surface and knead the dough for 5-10 minutes until it is springy and elastic (photo 5).</li>
        <li>At this point, if you prod the dough with your finger it should bounce back – this indicates that the gluten has successfully developed. Cover the dough and leave to rest for 10 minutes. </li>

        <img src="https://shivanilovesfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aloo-Paratha-4.jpg" height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li>Now we can begin rolling the parathas! Take a golf-ball sized piece of dough and roll into a small circle on a floured surface. Add some filling to the center of the circle (photo 6).</li>

        <img src="https://shivanilovesfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Aloo-Paratha-6.jpg" height = "200">&nbsp;
        
        <li>Next, tightly wrap the dough around the filling (photo 7) until it is fully encased. Add more flour to your surface as needed, then roll out the paratha into a large circle (photo 8).</li>

        <Li>Cook the parathas on a tawa or frying pan over medium-high heat: generously brush the hot tawa with oil, then carefully place the paratha on top. Brush the top of the paratha with oil and flip when bubbles appear. Cook the paratha until it is bubbly and golden on both sides (photo 9).</Li>

      <h5>Khaman, also known as Khaman Dhokla in other Indian states, is a popular delicacy from the Gujarati cuisine.<br>

        This popular light and spongy snack is made with a leavened batter of a spiced gram flour batter, that is later steamed in a pan. <br>A tempering of spices and herbs is made which is then drizzled over this steamed cake</h5>
      
      <h3>Recipe Module : -</h3>
      <h3>What ingredients will I need?</h3>

      <ul>
       <Li> Eno (Fruit Salt) -  results in a light and fluffy texture</Li>
      <li>Lemon juice or Citric Acid -  Citric acid gives a superb fluffy texture.</li>
      <li>1 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon semolina (sooji)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ginger-green chili paste </li>
      <li>Sugar ,salt,water</li>
      <li>oil,mustard seeds,curry leaves,sesame seeds,green chillies</li>
      <li>Pinch of hing </li>
      <li>grated coconut (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to make Khaman Dhokla:</h3>

      <ol>
        <li> Begin by Grease a steamer pan with 2 to 3 teaspoons oil.</li> 
        <br><li>Take 1.5 cups gram flour (120 grams besan) in a mixing bowl or pan. Do use gram flour which has a fine texture.</li>

        <li>Add 
          <ul>
            <li>2 to 3 pinches of turmeric powder</li>
           <li> a generous pinch of asafoetida (skip to make a gluten-free version)</li>
          <li>1.5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice or ⅓ to ½ teaspoon pure citric acid</li>
          <li>1.5 teaspoons ginger paste (crush 1.5 inch ginger and 1.5 teaspoons green chilies in a mortar-pestle)</li>
          <li>1.5 teaspoons green chili paste</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon sugar or add according to taste</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt or add as per taste</li>
          </ul>
          </li><br>
        <li>Add 1 cup water (or more or less as needed) and 1 tablespoon oil to make a thick yet smooth flowing batter.<br>

          The amount of water needed depends on the quality of flour, so start with 1 cup and add as required. Stir well to combine. </li>

        <li>Then add 1 tablespoon rava (semolina). This is entirely optional but adds a good texture to the khaman. Skip rava or semolina for a gluten-free option.Stir with a whisk to create a smooth, thick batter without any lumps.</li>

        <li>The batter should be thick yet flow easily off of the whisk. A quick tip is that if the batter becomes thin, then 1 to 2 tablespoons of gram flour.

          Next bring 2 to 2.5 cups of water to a boil in a steamer pan or electric cooker or pressure cooker. The amount of water to be added depends on the size of the steamer or pressure cooker.</li>
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe7.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li>Next add 2 teaspoons Eno or fruit salt. 2 teaspoons of Eno makes the khaman soft and fluffy. But there is a slightly alkaline taste to Eno.

          If you’re not a fan of this flavor then add only 1.5 teaspoons of Eno. If using baking soda as your leavening agent add ½ teaspoon to ¾ teaspoon.</li>
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe8.jpg  "height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li>Stir and mix the eno with the batter briskly and quickly.</li>
        <li>The fruit salt should be mixed evenly with the batter. Or else you get uneven texture in the khaman</li>
        <li>The eno will make the batter become frothy, so you need to work quickly to whisk it in thoroughly.</li>

<li>Pour the prepared batter into the greased pan.</li>
<li>Gently shake so that the batter evens out in the pan. Below is a picture of the batter ready to be steamed.</li>

<h3>Steam</h3>

        <Li>Place the pan in a steamer or electric rice cooker or pressure cooker. The water should already be boiling or hot when you place the pan with the khaman batter.

          When using a pressure cooker, remove the vent weight/whistle from the lid and cover the cooker tightly with its lid.</Li>
       <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe14.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;

       <li> Steam for 15 to 20 minutes in an electric rice cooker. If using a pan or pressure cooker or Instant Pot, steam for 12 to 15 minutes on a medium to medium-high heat.

        In the below photo the khaman is cooked for 17 minutes using an electric rice cooker</li>
        <li>To check the doneness, insert a toothpick. It should come out clean if the khaman is done. If the toothpick has the batter on it, then you need to steam for another minutes or so.</li>
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe16.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe17.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li> Let the khaman become warm or cool completely. Gently slide a butter knife along the edges to release the khaman from the pan. Place a plate or tray on top of the pan</li>
        <li>Then quickly invert the pan.</li>
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe18.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe19.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li> If greased well, the khaman will easily slide out onto the plate.</li>
        <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe20.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
        <li>Use a sharp knife to slice the khaman in squares and set aside until ready to temper.

          Since I used a concave plate, the khaman settled down in the center. This won’t happen if you use a flat plate</li>
          <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe21.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;

          <h3>Temper Khaman Dhokla</h3>
          <li>Tempering is essential to infuse the khaman with flavor and add moisture to the gram flour sponge. To make the temper, first heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a small pan on the stove. Use peanut oil or any neutral-tasting oil.</li>
          <li>Add 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.</li>
          <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe23.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
          <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe24.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
          <li>When the mustard seeds are crackling, add 10 to 12 curry leaves, and, if you like, 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and 1 teaspoon of chopped green chili.</li>
          <li>Stir and then add 2 teaspoons white sesame seeds.</li>
          <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe25.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
          <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe26.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
<li>Next carefully add ⅓ cup of water. You can switch off the heat when adding water.</li>
<img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe28.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;
<li>Next add 2 teaspoons of sugar.Stir and allow the tempering mixture to come to a boil. Make sure that the sugar is dissolved.</li>

<img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/khaman-dhokla-recipe30.jpg"height = "200">&nbsp;

<li>Remove from the heat and immediately pour this tempering mixture evenly on the khaman dhokla so that it seeps through the sliced edges</li>
<li>Garnish with 2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves and 2 to 3 tablespoons grated coconut, if you like.</li>
