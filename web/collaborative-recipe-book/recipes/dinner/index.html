         <ol>
          <li>Add the black eyed peas, broth, water and salt to large pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to simmer. Then go to Step 2 to 3.</li>
          <li>To keep them whole for salads and Texas caviar, cook them 40 to 50 minutes until just tender but they still hold their shape, then drain. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days. You can also freeze for up to 8 months. Place the drained black eyed peas into a sealable storage container like a mason jar.
             It’s helpful to freeze them in 1 ½ cup increments, which equals 1 15-ounce can of beans</li>
             <li>For the creamy side dish, cook 55 to 60 minutes until very tender and just starting to break down. If the beans start to appear before becoming tender, top off with water to keep the beans just barely submerged. At the end of cooking there will still be a good amount of water: you’ll use this to create the creamy sauce. Add the garlic, smoked paprika, oregano, onion powder, and butter (optional), then turn up the heat and stir vigorously for a few minutes until a creamy sauce forms. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 5 days.</li>

         <h3>Ingredient List for Chicken Biryani</h3>
         <ol>
          <li>Chicken — Chicken drumsticks and thighs are ideal for this recipe, 
            as these retain moisture during the slow cooking process, resulting in juicy and succulent chicken.  </li>
            <li>Rice — Extra long Basmati rice is the most preferred choice for making Chicken Biryani. When cooked, the grains stay separate and fluffy and absorb the flavors of the spices and chicken well.
               Look out for the properly aged fragrant basmati rice for best results.</li>
               <li>Ginger and Garlic paste — A fundamental component of most savory dishes, ginger and garlic infuse the dish with a depth of flavor. The zesty warmth of ginger
                 combines with the spicy earthiness of the garlic, adding an aromatic richness to the marinade. </li>
                 <li>Fresh herbs — Cilantro and mint are vital components of this Chicken biryani as they elevate the overall taste of the recipe. They add a burst of freshness to the dish and infuse a delightful fragrance
                   while balancing the richness of spices and other ingredients. </li>
                   <li>Onions — They are one of the significant ingredients of this Chicken Biryani, and a lot of them are used here. The crispy fried caramelized onions, called Birista, are 
                    the key components that are used for garnishing and adding a smokey sweetness to the dish. </li>
                    <li>Whole Spices — The hallmark of traditional biryani recipes, whole spices create an aromatic base that infuses into the entire dish, imparting a unique flavor profile. Bay leaves, whole black cardamom, star anise, cinnamon sticks, cloves, peppercorns, and shahi jeera are the significant
                       spices rendering depth and complexity of flavors to the recipe. </li>
                       <li>Spices and seasonings — Creating a delectable balance of heat, earthiness, and sweetness, the spices and herbs elevate the deliciousness of the biryani. Degi mirch, coriander powder, turmeric, garam masala powder, mace, and salt are the essential spices and 
                        seasonings used to make this soul ravisher.</li>
                        <li>Milk and Saffron — Saffron threads soaked in warm milk impart a vibrant yellow color to the dish besides the exquisite aroma.
                           Saffron-infused milk enhances the overall taste and adds a subtle, luxurious flavor to the recipe. </li>
                           <li>Yogurt and Lime juice — Used in the marinade for their unique qualities, yogurt and lime juice are the essential ingredients of this recipe. Lime juice tenderizes the chicken while also adding citrusy notes to the dish.
                             Yogurt also helps tenderize the chicken while rendering creamy richness to the marinade. </li>
                             <li>Ghee + Oil — Any neutral, refined oil is good for cooking the biryani. But homemade desi ghee will create wonders.</li>

         </ol>

         <h3>Recipe</h3>
         <ol>
          <li>Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, salt, and lemon juice. Add the chicken pieces, mix well, and let it marinate for at least 1 hour (preferably overnight) in the refrigerator.</li>

            <li>Cook the rice: Wash and soak the basmati rice for 30 minutes. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamoms, cinnamon stick, and salt. Add the soaked rice and cook until it's 70% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Prepare the biryani: In a large pot or biryani pan, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown. Add slit green chilies, mint leaves, and coriander leaves. Cook for a minute.</li>
            
            <li>Layering: Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until the chicken is half-cooked. Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken. Drizzle the saffron milk over the rice. You can also add some fried onions for extra flavor.</li>
            
           <li> Dum cooking: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to prevent steam from escaping. Cook on low heat for about 25-30 minutes until the chicken and rice are fully cooked and infused with flavors.</li>
            
            <li>Serve: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, garnish with fresh coriander leaves and fried onions. Serve hot with raita or your favorite side dish.</li>
